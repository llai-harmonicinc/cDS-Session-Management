autonumber
    Note over P: Player requests DNS resolution for the CDN domain
    P->>+RecursiveDNS: DNS Query for cdn.example.com

    Note over RecursiveDNS: Recursive DNS resolver forwards query to authoritative DNS (Traffic Router)
    RecursiveDNS->>+TrafficRouter: DNS Query for cdn.example.com
    
    Note over TrafficRouter: Traffic Router checks the available edge servers and their health
    TrafficRouter->>TrafficMonitor: Request server health info
    TrafficMonitor-->>TrafficRouter: EdgeServer1: Healthy, EdgeServer2: Healthy

    TrafficRouter->>+EdgeServer1: Health check (EdgeServer1)
    TrafficRouter->>+EdgeServer2: Health check (EdgeServer2)

    Note over TrafficRouter: Traffic Router selects the best edge server based on proximity, health, and load
    TrafficRouter-->>-RecursiveDNS: DNS Response (IP of EdgeServer1)

    Note over RecursiveDNS: Recursive DNS sends the resolved IP to the client
    RecursiveDNS-->>-P: DNS Response (IP of EdgeServer1)

    Note over P: Player sends HTTP request to EdgeServer1
    P->>+EdgeServer1: GET /video.mp4

    break
    Note over EdgeServer1: EdgeServer1 suddenly goes offline
    EdgeServer1--xTrafficMonitor: Server down!
    EdgeServer1-->P: ETIMEDOUT
    end
    TrafficMonitor-->>TrafficRouter: EdgeServer1: Unhealthy
    
    Note over TrafficRouter: Traffic Router receives updated health status from Traffic Monitor
    TrafficRouter->>TrafficMonitor: Request updated health info
    TrafficMonitor-->>TrafficRouter: EdgeServer1: Unhealthy, EdgeServer2: Healthy

    Note over TrafficRouter: Traffic Router removes EdgeServer1 from routing pool and selects EdgeServer2
    TrafficRouter->>RecursiveDNS: DNS Response (IP of EdgeServer2)

    loop 
        Note over P: Player retry while DNS record is not expired
        P->>+EdgeServer1: GET /video.mp4
        EdgeServer1-->P: ETIMEDOUT
    end
    Note over P: DNS resolution expire and Player retries DNS resolution after EdgeServer1 failure
    P->>+RecursiveDNS: DNS Query for cdn.example.com (retry)

    RecursiveDNS->>+TrafficRouter: DNS Query for cdn.example.com (retry)
    TrafficRouter-->>-RecursiveDNS: DNS Response (IP of EdgeServer2)
    RecursiveDNS-->>-P: DNS Response (IP of EdgeServer2)

    Note over P: Player sends HTTP request to EdgeServer2
    P->>+EdgeServer2: GET /video.mp4 (retry request)
    EdgeServer2-->>P: 200 OK\n(video.mp4)
